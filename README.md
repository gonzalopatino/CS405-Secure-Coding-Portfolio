## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains the final portfolio for **CS-405 Secure Coding**.  
It showcases practical skills in secure software development, risk analysis, and the application of secure coding principles based on *Seacord (2013)*.

The portfolio demonstrates how to:
- Integrate security early in the software development life cycle.
- Evaluate and mitigate risks using cost-benefit analysis.
- Apply Zero Trust principles through validation and least privilege.
- Implement effective and enforceable security policies.

## ðŸ§  Learning Summary
Through this course, I gained experience in:
- Writing secure and maintainable code in C/C++.  
- Identifying common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and injection attacks.  
- Implementing layered defenses and static/dynamic code analysis tools.  
- Understanding that security must be built **from the start**, not added later.
